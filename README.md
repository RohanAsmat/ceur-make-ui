##Prerequisites

In order to install it on your local machine and start playing with the code, the setup is simple. The only prerequisite to start working with the code is to have AMP stack working that is Apache, MySQL and PHP. You can either go with installing the stack manually or the bundle comes in couple of flavours that you can install from their respective sites as listed below:

+ [XAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html): For OsX, Windows and Linux
+ [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/): For OsX and Windows
+ [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/): For Windows

You can either go with one of these bundles or set up one of your own choice that can help you running with the AMP( Apache, MySQL and PHP ) stack. Once the bundle is installed on your local machine, you can clone the [ceur-make-ui](https://github.com/ceurws/ceur-make-ui) code into **htdocs** directory in case of XAMP or MAMP and **www** directory in case of WAMP.

##Up and Running
Once you are done installing the AMP stack and cloning the ceur-make-ui code in the concerned directory that is **htdocs** or **www**, you can go to the following path in the ceur-make-ui directory:

*ceur-make-ui/CeurMakeGUI/index/* 

Once, you are in the index directory, you can double click the index.html to run in the browser or you can code editor of your choice to start playing with the code. Advanced techniques to use the code are discussed in the next section.
